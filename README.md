# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview of the analysis
The purpose of this project is to provide a detailed database analysis for Pewlett Hackard company on number of retiring employees and which departments and what kind of title they are holding now. So the company can prepare the hiring and mentorship initiative to prevent the short of staff and management in the future. 
## Results
* From the table below, we can see the number of retiring employees and their titles. Among all of the retiring employees, about 70% of them are with senior titles. And 2 of the managers are retiring too.
